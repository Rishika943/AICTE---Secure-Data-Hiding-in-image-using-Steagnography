# AICTE---Secure-Data-Hiding-in-image-using-Steagnography


📌 **Project Overview**

This project provides a secure and user-friendly way to encrypt and decrypt messages within images using steganography and password protection. The message is embedded inside an image using OpenCV and can only be retrieved with the correct password.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python – Programming language

OpenCV – Image processing

NumPy – Array manipulation

PyQt6 – Graphical User Interface (GUI)


🔥 **Features**

✔ Steganography-based encryption – Hides messages within image pixels.

✔ Password-protected decryption – Ensures secure message retrieval.

✔ Graphical User Interface (GUI) – Easy-to-use interface.

✔ No need for external storage – The message is stored directly in the image.

✔ Works with PNG images – Saves encrypted images in lossless format.


**Install dependencies:**

pip install opencv-python numpy PyQt6

🚀 Usage

Encrypt an Image

Run the encryption script:

python encrypt_gui.py

Enter the secret message and password.

Click on Encrypt Image, and it will generate an encrypted image.

Decrypt an Image

Run the decryption script:
python decrypt_gui.py
Enter the password used during encryption.
If the password is correct, the hidden message will be revealed.
